# Luong-regular
It's me, but if I was never adopted.

Created during the graphic design workshop "Cast of Characters" in Seoul, SK. We developed a fictional character, I created an alternative me but if I stayed in Vietnam and never had a family. I imagined myself as being sharp, resourceful and withdrawn on the outside and traumatized (from never being loved) on the inside.
